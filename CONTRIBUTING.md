# Contributing guidelines

We are very happy about all kinds of contributions. Thanks for considering to
help us out! The simplest way of contributing is to give feedback on the
project, either via creating an issue here on GitHub or by sending a message to
a maintainer. You can also report bugs that you may have found in this manner.

## Filing issues

File issues using the standard Github issue tracker for the repo.
